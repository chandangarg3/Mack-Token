Simple ERC20 Token Smart Contract
This repository contains a simple Solidity smart contract for an ERC20 token along with instructions for deploying and interacting with it using Remix.

Smart Contract Details
Name: MyToken
Symbol: MT
Decimals: 18
Initial Supply: Set during deployment
Getting Started
Open Remix in your web browser.

Create a new file named ERC20Token.sol in Remix.

Copy and paste the contents of the ERC20Token.sol file from this repository into the newly created file in Remix.

Compile the smart contract by selecting the appropriate Solidity version (e.g., 0.8.0) in Remix's Compiler tab and clicking the "Compile" button.

Deploy the smart contract:

Go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in Remix.
Select the ERC20Token contract from the dropdown.
Enter the initial supply (as a whole number) for your token.
Click the "Transact" button to deploy the contract.
Interact with the deployed contract:

Once the contract is deployed, you will see its interface in Remix's "Deployed Contracts" section.
Use the provided functions (e.g., transfer, approve, transferFrom) to interact with your ERC20 token.
Note
This is a basic example of an ERC20 token contract for educational purposes. It does not include advanced features like access control or security mechanisms. Use it as a starting point and consider additional security and functionality considerations for production use.

Remember that deploying and interacting with smart contracts on the Ethereum network requires real Ether (ETH) for gas fees.

Happy coding!
